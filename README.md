# Agentic DNA by Cheshire Terminal
Welcome to **Agentic DNA**, an innovative project powered by the Wonderland framework on the Solana blockchain. Agentic DNA generates unique, DNA-like sequences for agents—think of them as users, bots, or autonomous entities—offering a fresh approach to creating distinct identities or traits in decentralized applications (dApps). Whether you're a developer, a blockchain enthusiast, or a contributor, this guide will walk you through everything you need to know about Agentic DNA.

## Introduction

Agentic DNA is a system built to provide unique identifiers or trait-defining sequences for agents within the Solana ecosystem. Leveraging Solana’s high-performance blockchain and the Wonderland framework’s robust tools, Agentic DNA ensures scalability, security, and ease of use. These sequences can be used in various dApps, such as NFT creation, identity management, or even gaming systems where unique agent characteristics are required.

This README will cover:
- What Agentic DNA is and how it works
- How to set up and install the project
- How to use it in practice
- How to contribute to its development

Let’s dive in!

## Technical Overview

Agentic DNA combines cryptographic techniques and blockchain technology to generate and manage unique sequences for agents. Each sequence is tied to an agent’s public key, ensuring that no two agents share the same "DNA." These sequences are lightweight and optimized for on-chain use, making them versatile for a wide range of applications.

### Architecture

The project is structured as follows:

- **Smart Contracts**: Written in Rust using the Anchor framework, the smart contracts are the backbone of Agentic DNA. They handle sequence generation, validation, and storage on the Solana blockchain.
- **Front-end**: A React-based web interface, integrated with Solana’s `web3.js` library, provides an easy way to interact with the system.
- **Wonderland Framework**: A powerful layer built on Solana, Wonderland simplifies dApp development by offering tools and abstractions tailored for this project.

The sequences themselves are generated using a combination of inputs (like an agent’s public key) and cryptographic functions, ensuring uniqueness and integrity. While the full sequence might be computed off-chain for efficiency, a hash or reference is stored on-chain for verification.

## Setup and Installation

To get started with Agentic DNA, you’ll need a Solana development environment and a few dependencies. Follow these steps to set up the project on your machine:

### Prerequisites

- **Solana CLI**: For interacting with the Solana blockchain.
- **Rust**: The programming language used for Solana smart contracts.
- **Anchor**: A framework for Solana development (optional, but assumed for this project).
- **Node.js**: For running the front-end and CLI tools.
- **Git**: To clone the repository.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Solana CLI**  
   Run the following command to install the Solana command-line tools:
   ```bash
   sh -c "$(curl -sSfL https://release.solana.com/v1.10.32/install)"
   ```
   Verify the installation:
   ```bash
   solana --version
   ```

2. **Install Rust**  
   Install the Rust toolchain with:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   ```
   Update Rust and add the wasm target for Solana:
   ```bash
   rustup update
   rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
   ```

3. **Install Anchor**  
   If Agentic DNA uses Anchor (common for Solana projects), install it:
   ```bash
   cargo install --git https://github.com/project-serum/anchor anchor-cli --locked
   ```

4. **Clone the Repository**  
   Grab the Agentic DNA source code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/cheshire-terminal/agentic-dna.git
   cd agentic-dna
   ```

5. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the Node.js dependencies for the front-end and CLI:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   Or, if you prefer Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

6. **Configure Environment Variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add the following:
   ```env
   SOLANA_CLUSTER=https://api.devnet.solana.com
   WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
   ```
   - Replace `your_private_key_here` with a base58-encoded private key for testing (e.g., from `solana-keygen new`).
   - Use `https://api.testnet.solana.com` for testnet or `http://localhost:8899` for a local validator.

7. **Start a Local Validator (Optional)**  
   For local testing, run:
   ```bash
   solana-test-validator
   ```

You’re now ready to explore Agentic DNA!

## Usage

Agentic DNA offers two primary ways to interact with the system: a command-line tool and a web interface. Below are instructions for both.

### Generating DNA Sequences via CLI

The project includes a CLI tool to generate DNA sequences for agents. To create a new sequence:

```bash
node cli.js generate-dna --agent-id <agent-public-key>
```

- Replace `<agent-public-key>` with a valid Solana public key (e.g., `5X7...abc`).
- Example output:
  ```
  Agent Public Key: 5X7k9...abc
  Generated DNA Sequence: ATGC-1234-XY89
  ```

The sequence is tied to the agent’s public key and can be used in downstream dApps.

### Using the Web Interface

To interact with Agentic DNA through a browser:

1. Start the web server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

3. Connect your Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom or Solflare) and follow the on-screen prompts to generate or view DNA sequences for your agent.

### Example Use Case: NFT Minting

If you’re building an NFT project, you can integrate Agentic DNA to assign unique traits to each NFT. After generating a DNA sequence, use it in your smart contract to mint an NFT with those traits:

```rust
// Example Rust snippet (simplified)
let dna_sequence = generate_dna(ctx.accounts.agent.key());
mint_nft(ctx, dna_sequence);
```

Check the project’s `/examples` directory for more detailed integration samples.
